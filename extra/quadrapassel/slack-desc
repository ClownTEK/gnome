# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

quadrapassel: quadrapassel (GNOME desktop game)
quadrapassel:
quadrapassel: Quadrapassel comes from the classic falling-block game, Tetris. The
quadrapassel: goal of the game is to create complete horizontal lines of blocks,
quadrapassel: which will disappear. The blocks come in seven different shapes made
quadrapassel: from four blocks each: one straight, two L-shaped, one square, and
quadrapassel: two S-shaped. The blocks fall from the top center of the screen in a
quadrapassel: random order. You rotate the blocks and move them across the screen
quadrapassel: to drop them in complete lines.
