# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

swell-foop: Swell Foop (GNOME desktop game)
swell-foop:
swell-foop: Swell Foop is a puzzle game, previously known as Same GNOME. The goal
swell-foop: is to remove the objects in as few moves as possible. Similar objects
swell-foop: that are adjacent to each other are removed as a group. The remaining
swell-foop: objects then collapse to fill in the gaps and new groups are formed.
swell-foop: You cannot remove single objects.
